# Gas-Leakage-Detector-Arduino-And-Assembly-Language-Implementation
Leakage of gas can potentially result in both material loss and human 
injuries. They can explode, cause fire, and even suffocate others depending 
upon their physical properties such as toxicity, flammability etc. In the past 
couple of years, the number of casualties because of gas leakage has 
increased dramatically. Old valves, substandard cylinders, worn out 
regulators and lack of awareness while handling gas are some of the reasons 
for gas explosions. LPG (or propane) and Natural Gas are the gases widely 
used as a source of fuel in homes because of its desirable properties like 
less smoke, less soot, and minimal harm to the environment. However, 
these gases are heavier than air and do not disperse easily. This may lead 
to suffocation or even worse, explosion! To avoid this problem there is a 
need for a system to detect the leakage of methane. Our Gas Leakage 
Detector will identify potentially hazardous gas in the atmosphere via MQ5 
Gas Sensor and will sound a buzzer indicating presence of such gases in 
the atmosphere. In a compact design, this detector can be placed on a 
ceiling of your kitchen or anywhere where there is a chance of gas leakage 
thus avoiding any dangers of gas leakage.
