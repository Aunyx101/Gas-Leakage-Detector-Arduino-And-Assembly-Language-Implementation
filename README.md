# Gas-Leakage-Detector-Arduino-And-Assembly-Language-Implementation
Leakage of gas can potentially result in both material loss and human  injuries. They can explode, cause fire, and even suffocate others depending  upon their physical properties such as toxicity, flammability etc. To avoid this problem there is a  need for a system to detect the leakage of methane.
